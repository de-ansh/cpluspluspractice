<h3><strong>History of army day: </strong> </h3>
<p> The Indian Army was officially established on April 1, 1895.  However, it was only in 1949 when the country got its first chief. On January 15, 1949, Lieutenant General KM Cariappa took over as the first Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from General Fransis Bucher, the last British Commander-in-Chief. Since then, the day is celebrated as Army Day.
